# Overview

Returns the class/method structure of .py and .ipynb files along with their docstrings in Markdown format

# Example Usage

```cmd
python folder_summarizer.py "C:\Users\Bryce\Desktop\Projects\AI-Builders-Bootcamp-5\session-1"
```

# Future Improvements

Would be interesting to combine this with an LLM that takes the file structure and any README.md files to create better documentation for a folder.
