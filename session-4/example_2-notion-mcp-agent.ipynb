      "If I started over today, here’s what I’d do instead:\n",
      "1. **Define your actual target audience and their burning problem.** Don’t rely on “adjacent” consulting insights—get direct validation from people who would pay for your product, not your advice.\n",
      "2. **Productize your offers early.** Turn repeat consulting solutions into a simple package, a resource, or even a prototype.\n",
      "3. **Prioritize learning from people 1–2 steps ahead.** Pay for their time. Books and podcasts are helpful, but the right 1:1 call can save you months of experimenting on your own.\n",
      "4. **Make feedback loops real and fast.** Ship something—even if it’s ugly, even if it’s not what you’d use yourself. Every customer interaction is real data.\n",
